# Command Zero Custom Investigation Questions

This repository contains a collection of queries designed to serve as starting points for custom investigation questions in the Command Zero autonomous investigation platform. These queries cover a variety of common threat hunting and investigation scenarios.

## Currently Supported Data Sources

## Contents

- **Microsoft Sentinel**: KQL queries optimized for Microsoft Sentinel data sources, focusing on identity, authentication, and permission-related threats.
- **Microsoft Defender XDR Advanced Hunting**: KQL queries for Microsoft Defender XDR Advanced Hunting, covering device, email, and network-based threat detection.

Each query is documented with comments explaining its purpose and can be directly imported into Command Zero or customized to meet your specific environmental requirements. These examples demonstrate effective techniques for threat hunting across various attack vectors including brute force attempts, suspicious authentications, phishing campaigns, and unusual administrative activities.
